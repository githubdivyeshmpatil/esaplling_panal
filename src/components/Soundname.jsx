            <strong>Large Field of View:</strong> PTZ cameras move anywhere between zero
            pan/tilt and the full 360° pan / 180° tilt. This gives control over
            the required field of view (FOV). PTZ cameras can be paired with
            stationary cameras to augment monitoring capability.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Motion-Based Auto Tracking:</strong> Auto tracking adjusts the field
            of view on the fly to follow moving objects in many PTZ cameras.
            It’s typically best applied in quiet areas with minimal movement.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Time-Based Auto Scan:</strong> Pan, tilt and zoom presets can be
            timed to capture different fields of view (FOV) over a surveillance
            zone.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Remote Camera Control:</strong> Tracking suspicious activity has
            never been easier with PTZ cameras. Remote camera control allows
            users to change the camera’s field of view without having to go
            onsite.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Zoom Capabilities:</strong> Optical and digital zoom features are
            useful features for PTZ cameras that allow you to see objects from
            miles away or focus on the details important for surveillance.
